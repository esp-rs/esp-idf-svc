## [0.49.0] - 2024-06-23

### Deprecated
**ESP-IDF v4.4** Please start upgrading to ESP-IDF v5.
### Breaking
* **removed** ESP-IDF v4.3 support, including mostly conditional compilations. (#431)
* wifi: now can use embedded-svc PmfConfiguration, ScanMethod, and ScanSortMethod in ClientConfiguration. (#381)
* wifi: The WifiEvent's ApStaConnected and ApStaDisconnected were changed to include the idf's wifi_event. (#396)
* eth: callbacks now use newly added EthFrames instead of &[u8]. (#406)
* wifi: callbacks now use newly added WifiFrames instead of &[u8]. (#406)
* http_server: Configuration now allows for setting the ctrl_port. (#427)
* http_server: UB fix: `handler`, `fn_handler` and `handler_chain` all now only accept `'static` callbacks,
  which is the only safe option in the presence of `core::mem::forget` on the HTTP server. All of those have the
  previous behavior preserved in the form of `unsafe` `*_nonstatic` variants which were added. (#437)
* tls: negotiate now returns the new CompletedHandshake struct instead of (). (#428)
* wifi: Remove AUTOUP as the default flag on ClientConfiguration:Fixed. (#426)
* tls: Allow TLS negotiation on a multi-threaded executor. (#432)
* MSRV: 1.77 (due to `core::net` which is re-exported by `embedded-svc` and is stable since Rust 1.77)
### Added
* tls: Support for TLS server. (#368)
* ws: expose crt_bundle_attach to EspWebSocketClientConfig. (#391)
* ping: can now be used with disabled IPv6. (#418)
* wifi: EspWifi's wrap_all method now supports only wrapping sta if softAp is disabled. (#376)
* sd: **New SD mmc & spi drivers**. Check out the sd_mmc and sd_spi examples. (#422)
* fs: new wrapper implementation around fat. (#422)
* tls: Make EspTls and EspAsyncTls Send when possible. (#429)
* ble/gatt: **New BLE GATT server support using Bluedroid.** Check out the bt_gatt_server example. (#421)
### Fixed
* nvs: encrypted partition could not find partition by name. (#387)
* ota: handle partition errors gracefully. (#393)
* http_client: flush responses to avoid repeated request failures. (#404)
* eth: missing error return inside the rx_callback function. (#414)
* wifi: AccessPointConfiguration now correctly limits max_connections. (#426)
* wifi: Fix WPS regression around null termination of ssid/password. (#379)
* Compatibility with ESP-IDF v5.3 (pre-release): various fixes such that esp-idf-svc can be used against the latest esp-idf versions. (#434)

## [0.48.1] - 2024-02-21
* Disable the `esp_idf_svc::io::vfs` module if the ESP IDF VFS component is not enabled either
* Bugfix / async MQTT: The internal `Unblocker` utility was missing `drop` and therefore did not delete its task properly, resulting in a crash when the async MQTT client is dropped
* #357 - `AsyncWifi` was not `Send` anymore (regression). `Send` restored.
* #356 - Change payload of `EspEventPostData` from `&[u32]` to `&[u8]`
* #357 - Restore `Send` for `AsyncWifi`
* #369 - (Crash) Restore the drop impl EspMqttClient
* #370 - (Deadlock) Fix a deadlock when dropping an MQTT client in the presence of a blocking EspMqttConnection
* Fix clippy duplicate imports warnings with latest 1.78 nightly

## [0.48.0] - 2024-01-26
* New examples: 
  * MQTT client (blocking and async)
  * TLS (async; blocking already exists)
  * Event loop (blocking and async)
  * Timers (blocking and async)
  * SPI Ethernet (async; a blocking example for RMII Ethernet already exists)
  * TCP client and server (blocking and async)
  * SNTP service
  * Websocket client (blocking)
* Breaking changes in module `eventloop`: 
  * Async send and receive functionality now implemented directly on the `esp-idf-svc` event loop types, as the `embedded_svc::utils::asyncify` module is now gone
  * Types `EspTypedEventLoop` and `EspPostbox` are now retired. Use `EspEventLoop` directly, as it has the same functionality
  * `EspEventFetchData` renamed to `EspEvent`; both `EspEvent` and `EspEventPostData` now lifetimed instead of using raw pointers
  * Trait `EspTypedEventSource` is renamed to `EspEventSource` and marked as unsafe (i.e., implementors should do `unsafe impl EspTypedEventSource for ...`); check the documentation of the trait for justification
  * Types `EspTypedEventDeserializer` and `EspTypedEventSerializer` renamed to just `EspEventSerializer` and `EspEventDeserializer`; more importantly, their payload is now modeled using a lifetimed GAT member called `Data<'a>`; this allows deserializers to implement zerocopy deserialization by referencing the event payload which is owned by the event loop; all `esp-idf-svc` deserializers (notably - `WifiEvent` and `IpEvent`) are now implemented with zerocopy, thus reducing the pressure on the system event loop task stack size
  * The `EspEvent` type is now also a dummy (no op) `EspEventDeserializer`; the `EspEventPostData` type is now also a dummy (no op) `EspEventSerializer`
  * Because of the above changes, methods `subscribe*` and `post*` are now slightly less convenient to use in that they need the (de)serializer specified using turbofish syntax, i.e. `event_loop.subscribe::<WifiEvent, _>(...)`; this is so because these methods no longer require (and cannot require - due to the lifetimed GAT from above) `where P: EspEvent(De)serializer<P>`, i.e. the event type *itself* to implement the (de)sderializer, even if all event types provided by `esp-idf-svc` do that
  * The `post*` and `spin` methods now take a timeout of type `TickType_t` as everywhere rather than the complex `Option<Duration>`
* Breaking changes in module `http::server`: 
  * Due to the breaking change in `embedded_svc::http::server`, whereas `HandlerError` and `HandlerResult` were removed, these types are no longer used in the `embedded_svc::http::server` module either. Check the Changelog of `embedded_svc` for more details
* Breaking change in module `timer`: all async timer functionality now implemented directly on the `esp-idf-svc` timer types, as the `embedded_svc::utils::asyncify` module is now gone
* Breaking changes in module `mqtt::client`: 
  * All async send/receive functionality now implemented directly on the `esp-idf-svc` MQTT types, as the `embedded_svc::utils::asyncify` module is now gone
  * Changes induced by breaking changes in `embedded_svc::mqtt::client` API contract:
    * All event conversion logic now retired, significantly simplifying the type signatures of `EspMqttClient` and `EspMqttConnection`, as well as the number of offered constructors
    * For MQTT events, user always gets an instance of `EspMqttEvent` which implements the `embedded_svc::mqtt::client::Event` trait - valid for both callback-based event processing as well as for connection-based blocking and asynchronous event processing
* Breaking change: `AsyncEspTls` renamed to `EspAsyncTls`
* MSRV 1.75; remove the nightly feature flag from all async trait implementations
* Update public dependency `heapless` to 0.8
* Remove dependency on `embassy-time` and replace it with a dependency on `embassy-time-driver`; get rid of the custom embassy time queue as it was anyway re-implementing something like a generic timer queue, which is available in the `embassy-time` crate (with its feature `generic-queue` enabled)
* #316 - breaking change addressing a typo - `http::server::Configuration::max_resp_handlers` renamed to `http::server::Configuration::max_resp_headers`
* #319 - Set default TTL in `EspPing` to 64
* #322 - Fix MQTT PSK code (did not compile)
* #323 - ETH example with a statically configured IP
* #324 - New methods in `EspWifi` to swap STA and AP netifs separately from each other
* #326 - logging from multiple threads in Rust/ESP-IDF no longer results in intermixed logs
* #331 - Add support for WPS

## [0.47.3] - 2023-11-12
* BREAKING CHANGE IN A PATCH RELEASE DUE TO DISCOVERED UB: All constructors and methods in the Classic BT services, as well as in
services `EspNow`, driver `EthDriver`, `EventLoop`, `Wait`, `EspHttpServer`, `EspMqttClient`, `EspSntp`, `EspTimerService`,
driver `WifiDriver` and `EspWebSocketClient` no longer accept non-static callbacks, as these lead to UB / crash when the service/driver/subscription 
is forgotten with e.g. `core::mem::forget`. Since local borrows are a very useful feature however, these are still allowed via the newly-introduced 
and `unsafe` methods/constructors that follow the naming pattern of the safe methods/constructors, but with a `_nonstatic` suffix attached.

## [0.47.2] - 2023-11-02
* Remove dependency on `AtomicU64` which is no longer supported by the upstream `*-espidf` targets
* HTTP client: support for chunked encoding of POST requests

## [0.47.1] - 2023-10-18
* Compatibility with `embedded-svc` 0.26.1

## [0.47.0] - 2023-10-17
* MSRV raised to 1.71
* New `experimental` module - `bt` - providing Bluetooth support based on the ESP-IDF Bluedroid implementation
  * Only classic BT supported for now (on the ESP32) with the following profiles: A2DP sink, AVRC controller, HFP client, GAP
  * BLE support in the works, but not buildable yet
* TLS over TCP/IP support in the `tls` module via `EspTls` and (for async mode) `AsyncEspTls`
* PSK support for `mqtt`
* Dependencies `esp-idf-sys` and `esp-idf-hal` are now re-exported as `esp_idf_svc::sys` and `esp_idf_svc::hal`
* Upgraded to `embedded-svc` 0.26
* OTA: New method: `EspOta::finish` that allows to postpone/avoid setting the updated partition as a boot one
* Breaking change: OTA: `EspOtaUpdate` now parametric over the lifetime of a mutable reference to `EspOta` and returned by value
* Breaking change: OTA: `EspOtaUpdate::abort` and `EspOtaUpdate::complete` now take `self` instead of `&mut self`
* Breaking change: HTTP server: Scoped handlers; handlers now need to live only as long as the `EspHttpServer` instance. Therefore, `EspHttpServer` is now lifetimed: `EspHttpServer<'a>`
* Breaking change: HTTP server: `EspHttpRequest` renamed to `EspHttpRawConnection`
* Breaking change: WS client: Scoped handler; the event handler now needs to live only as long as the `EspWebSocketClient` instance. Therefore, `EspWebSocketClient` is now lifetimed: `EspWebSocketClient<'a>` 
* Breaking change: EspTimerService: scoped handler: the timer callback now only needs to live as long as the returned `EspTimer` instance. Therefore, `EspTimer` is now lifetimed: `EspTimer<'a>`
* Breaking change: EspEventLoop: scoped handler: the subscription callback now only needs to live as long as the returned `EspSubscription` instance. Therefore, `EspSubscription` is now lifetimed: `EspSubscription<'a, ...>`
* Breaking change: MQTT client: Scoped handler; the event handler now needs to live only as long as the `EspMqttClient` instance. Therefore, `EspMqttClient` is now lifetimed: `EspMqttClient<'a, ...>` 
* Breaking change: EspNow client: Scoped handlers; the event handlers now need to live only as long as the `EspNow` instance. Therefore, `EspNow` is now lifetimed: `EspNow<'a>` 
* Breaking change: Sntp client: Scoped handler; the event handler now needs to live only as long as the `EspSntp` instance. Therefore, `EspSntp` is now lifetimed: `EspSntp<'a>` 
* Breaking change (bugfix): Ping client: `EspPing::ping_details` now takes a `FnMut` callback, however the callback needs to be `Send`
* Breaking change: Removed the deprecated module `httpd` and the dependency on `anyhow`
* Breaking change: module `notify` removed as it was rarely - if ever - used, and there is a simpler `hal::task::notification` module now
* Deprecated: Using ESP-IDF 4.3 is now deprecated and all special cfg flags will be removed in the next release

## [0.46.2] - 2023-07-30

* `OTA` - small API extensions
* `netif` - compilation errors when PPP & SLIP support is enabled are addressed
* HTTP client & server - various bugfixes
* `EspError::from_infallible`

## [0.45.0] - 2022-12-13

HTTP server:
* Compatibility with `embedded-svc` V0.24
* New function - `fn_handler` that addresses HRTB lifetime issues when converting a Fn closure to a `Handler` instance
* Remove `EspHttpFnTraversableChain`; it is not necessary, now that the `fn_handler` function from above does exist

## [0.44.0] - 2022-12-09

Rebase on top of `esp-idf-sys` 0.32:
* Retire any usages of `esp-idf-sys::c_types` in favor of `core::ffi`

Patch releases to fix compilation errors under no_std.

## [0.43.0] - 2022-11-01

Release 0.43 is a backwards-incompatible release where almost all services were touched in one way or another.

### Major Changes

The main themes of the 0.43 release are:
* Public API
* Separate the notions of using a "nightly" compiler (which is a precondition for all async support) from "experimental" features, which might or might not be async-related
* Expose access to the wrapped ESP IDF services / drivers
* Wifi & Eth: separate layer 2 (ethernet) from layer 3 (IP)
* Http client & server: implement the new traits from `embedded-svc`
* Merge the `nvs_storage` module into `nvs`
* Support for the `embassy-time` crate by providing alarm implementation
* Support for the `embassy-time` crate by providing timer queue implementation

### Major changes elaboration

### Public API

In addition to implementing the `embedded-svc` traits where possible, all services now have public API. While the public API loosely follows the APIs from `embedded-svc`, it deviates where appropriate so that the native underlying ESP IDF service is better utilized.

These public APIs mean that the user is no longer required to depend on the `embedded-svc` crate so as to consume the `esp-idf-svc` services.
Consuming the services via the `embedded-svc` traits is now only necessary when the user is targetting cross-platform portability of their application code.

### Expose access to the wrapped ESP IDF services / drivers

All services now implement the `Handle` trait which does provide a reference to the native underlying ESP IDF service or driver. This is useful when the Rust wrapper for the service does not expose a particular functionality, as in that case, users can still call the functionality by using the raw `esp-idf-svc` bindings for the service.

### Wifi & Eth: separate layer 2 (Ethernet) from layer 3 (IP)

The Wifi and Ethernet drivers are now split into two separate structures:
* `WifiDriver` / `EthDriver` - these are layer 2 (Ethernet) drivers which follow all the conventions of the other drivers in the `esp-idf-hal` crate, including the need to own or mutably borrow the actual petihperal (the Wifi modem peripheral or the RMII / SPI peripheral from `esp-idf-hal`). They are however part of `esp-idf-svc` as this is better aligned with their native ESP IDF counterparts, which actually do use/rely on certain ESP IDF services, like the event loop and NVS storage, which - being services - are also exposed as part of `esp-idf-svc`, and not as part of `esp-idf-hal`. These drivers implement the `Wifi` and `Eth` traits respectively, which were redesigned to not have any IP-related semantics. Users are allowed to use the Layer 2 drivers directly by providing their own custom RX callbacks, thus completely bypassing the ESP IDF LwIP IP & Netif layer (i.e. with `smoltcp` or other 3rd party IP stack)
* `EspWifi` / `EspEth` - these are layer 3 (IP) + layer 2 (Ethernet) services, which - on construction - are expected to own a `WifiDriver` / `EthDriver` - either by constructing it themselves, or by the user passing the driver. These services "glue" the ESP IDF IP & Netif layer (`EspNetif`) with the ethernet layer provided by the drivers. These services *also* implement the `Wifi` / `Eth` traits, as they are wrapping Layer 2 functionality anyway. The Layer 3 functionality (configuring the network interface as well as fetching IP-related information from the network interfaces) however uses custom methods on the services' themselves and is not (yet) abstracted using `embedded-svc` traits.

Additionally, the `Wifi` and `Eth` trait implementations now provide finer grained control over the behavior of their drivers / services in that users should explicitly call `start`/`stop` to start/stop the driver, as well as `connect`/`disconnect` (for the Wifi driver in STA mode) to connect to an access point. While this makes the driver configuration a bit more involved, these changes provide the necessary flexibility for some corner use cases:
* When the Wifi driver is used together with the `EspNow` ESP NOW service, there is no need to actually `connect` the driver at all, which is now possible
* More complex connect/disconnect schemes can now be implemented by users, for roaming or for reacting in case the Wifi connection is lost

### Http client & server: implement the new traits from `embedded-svc`

Subject says it all, so to say.

### Merge the `nvs_storage` module into `nvs`

* The previous distinction of two separate modules was awkward and is thus removed
* The other notable change here is that the ESP IDF implementation actually only implements the `RawStorage` trait, which provides facilities for reading / writing blobs. It is up to the user to layer a `Storage` implementation on top of the `RawStorage` implementation, but the benefit of that is that user is in control of how their structures are serialized/deserialized into binary. To ease the layering, users may take advantage of the `StorageImpl` structure from `embedded-svc` and only provide a `Serde` trait implementation which abstracts away the concrete Rust SerDe implementation (i.e. `serde-json`, `postcard`, etc.)

### Support for the `embassy-time` crate by providing alarm implementation

`esp-idf-svc` provides an implementation of `embassy-time`'s alarm interface (the `Driver` trait), which is implemented in terms of the ESP IDF Timer service (also exposed in the `timer` module of `esp-idf-svc`). 

To use this feature, users need to enable the `embassy-time-driver` Cargo feature.

### Support for the `embassy-time` crate by providing timer queue implementation

`esp-idf-svc` does provide a custom `embassy-time` Timer Queue implementation (also implemented in terms of the ESP IDF Timer service), even though in the meantime `embassy-time` features a generic timer queue which works everywhere and can also be used. This custom timer queue does not rely on the alarms interface provided by the `embassy-time` crate (see the previous section).

The one major difference between `embassy-time`'s generic timer queue, and the one provided by `esp-idf-svc` is that the latter has a slightly lower latency in that it does support the `CONFIG_ESP_TIMER_SUPPORTS_ISR_DISPATCH_METHOD=y` ESP IDF configuration parameter. When this parameter is enabled, the `esp-idf-svc` timer queue does not use the ESP IDF Timer Service dispatch task/thread and notifies the executor about due timers **directly from the ISR routine**. When this parameter is not enabled, the `esp-idf-svc` timer queue has no benefits compared to the generic timer queue in `embassy-time`.

NOTE: 
* The `esp-idf-svc` timer queue should **only** be used with async executors that are ISR safe, in that they can be awoken from an ISR. `edge-executor` is such an executor.
* `embassy-executor` is currently NOT ISR safe, because it relies - for its synchronization - on the `critical-section` crate, yet the critical section implementation that the `critical-section` crate uses on top of `esp-idf-hal` is based on a FreeRTOS mutex, and NOT on a disable-all-interupts ISR-safe implementation (that is, unless the user has configured a more elaborate setup with their own critical section implementation). On the other hand, `embassy-executor` has its own highly optimized timer queue which should probably be used anyway and is enabled by default
* All other executors can just use the generic timer queue implementation which is built-in in the `embassy-time` crate

To use this feature, users need to enable the `embassy-time-isr-queue` Cargo feature.
